# INT375 PROJECT

This project focuses on analyzing air pollution levels in **India** by examining the concentration of key pollutants such as **PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and CO**. The goal is to identify **pollution trends over time**, compare air quality across states, and highlight the most and least polluted regions. The dataset contains air quality measurements from various cities as of **26-03-2024 22:00**, providing valuable insights into the current environmental conditions.

The project is implemented in **Python** using `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn` for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. It includes **daily progress updates** uploaded to GitHub, covering data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and trend analysis. Through this project, the aim is to present meaningful insights into India's air quality and visualize pollution patterns effectively.
